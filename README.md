## Introduction

Transfer learning involves reusing a pre-trained model on a new, related task. This project demonstrates how to implement transfer learning using neural networks, providing a foundation for applying this technique to various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and more.

## Features

- Utilizes pre-trained models for new tasks
- Demonstrates transfer learning with popular neural network architectures
- Provides detailed steps for fine-tuning and evaluating models
- Includes code for data preprocessing and augmentation

## Dataset

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture

The project leverages popular pre-trained model:
- VGG19

These models are fine-tuned for the new task using the provided dataset.

## Transfer Learning Process

1. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Load a model pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet.
2. **Freeze Initial Layers**: Freeze the initial layers to retain learned features.
3. **Add Custom Layers**: Add new layers specific to the new task.
4. **Fine-tuning**: Train the model on the new dataset, adjusting the learning rate and unfreezing some layers if necessary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn`
